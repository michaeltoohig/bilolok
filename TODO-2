Roadmap for current project codebase update.

I want to deploy the codebase consistently all in docker rather than what I have now of the backend and frontend and separate services as 3 elements to juggle to deploy.
Perhaps frontend can be outside of docker but I can get code reload working for frontend and backend in docker for development as I have for another project.

- [ ] Update dev docker config with explicit envvars
Implicit envvars in docker-compose makes it hard to reason about IMO.
- [x] Makefile for easy dev, setup, deploy, etc.
I am finding it hard to figure out how I setup for development in the past.
Clearly my system wasn't that great but Docker-for-Windows has since improved and I can get everything into docker now.
- [ ] Deploy on VPS

- [x] Frontend docker for development
Mkae it easier for development in future
- [ ] Update Python version
3.8 is getting a tad old
- [ ] Update SQLAlchemy
Requires big update to CRUD classes to account for this
